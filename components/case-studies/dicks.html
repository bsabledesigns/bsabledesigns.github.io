                    As a a part of the Customer Returns team, I was tasked with
                    designing an optimized in-store and online returns process,
                    that would increase both customer and employee satisifaction
                    while generating a cost savings for the company.

                  <span style="font-weight: 400;">
                    Current return processes were inefficient and overly
                    complicated leading to lower customer satisfaction and
                    reducing repeat customers. Our goal was to create a
                    streamlined process, and the supporting digital elements and
                    infrastructure, that would simplify in-store and online
                    returns. The key challenge in revamping was balancing the
                    needs of both the customer and stakeholder while reducing
                    costs. Working collaboratively as a part of a
                    interdisciplinary team, my role in was to understand and
                    represent the diverse users needs in all phases of the
                    project--research, planning, design and execution--while
                    remaining focused on the business goals of the stakeholder.

                <p class="col-md-8">
                  The first step in the Discovery phase was to identify and
                  translate the stakeholder's internal goals and business needs
                  into clearly defined, measurable objectives. Once we were
                  aligned on the stakeholderâ€™s objectives, we began researching
                  the as-is returns process to identify weakness, gaps and areas
                  for improvement across the business chain. We interviewed
                  customers, followed employees and customers in-store, read
                  CSAT comments, and observed interactions and processes in
                  customer service and distribution centers. Based on an
                  analysis of the information collected, we were able to
                  identify a number of pain points and opportunities in the
                  current returns process. Among other insights, we identified
                  numerous inefficiencies in the by-mail returns process that
                  were lowering customer satisfaction and losing revenue for the
                  company.

                <p class="col-md-8">
                  Our goal in framing was to define a solution that met the
                  needs of the user and to prioritize its key features. Based on
                  our Discovery, we identified many pain points surrounding the
                  mail-in returns process. Once aligned on the core issues the
                  new product should address, we researched best practices and
                  ran ideation sessions where we developed and analyzed
                  potential solutions. Next, we prioritized potential solutions
                  based on their technical complexity and whether they met our
                  objectives, aligned with business needs, and resolved user
                  pains. I led sketching workshops to develop a prototype of the
                  product that met our core objectives and the prioritized
                  business and user needs. Through these exercises, we were able
                  to define a self-service return solution with downloadable
                  shipping labels as our focus.

                  A key element of our design process was the validation of
                  solutions. During this phase, we wanted to ensure that all
                  proposed solutions were necessary, met our objectives and
                  added value. One way we did this was by running brief but
                  important experiments. For instance, based on our analysis, we
                  believed that users wanted to be able to download return
                  labels, a hypothesis we were able to validate through running
                  experiments. This led us to focus on developing that
                  particular capability. We repeated the validation process for
                  several other features.

                  Our team focused on using lean processes to build out new
                  self-service capabilities. Through an iterative process
                  involving team sketch sessions and the constant integration of
                  user feedback, I was able to design and build out new
                  self-service returns options for customers. I worked closely
                  with the developers in order to ensure we were always making
                  the best decisions design-wise and technically.

                    employees and the business as a whole. My role was not only
                    to advocate for the user, but to empower other team members
                    to be a part of UX process, integrating user needs into all
                    aspects of the design and execution of the solution. With a
