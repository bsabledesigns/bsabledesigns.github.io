                                <p class="col-md-8">TX is a company that links landlords with potential renters as well
                                    as renters with roommates through their app. In large cities with a shortage of
                                    places to rent, it’s difficult for the landlords, the renters and the roommates to
                                    find each other efficiently, and TX aims to change that.</p>

                                        app based on the Tinder’s idea of swiping. In addition to creating an easy to
                                        use interface, they asked me to &nbsp;figure out a way to incorporate different

                                <p class="col-md-8">My first step was to do research on the current products on the
                                    market along with Tinder. I worked with the stakeholder to brainstorm about how the
                                    product would work and create a features list. Users personas were created to keep
                                    users in mind when making the user flow and building wireframes and prototypes. The
                                    prototype was made in InVision, so users can demo the app to find
                                    potential&nbsp;problems
                                    in the usability and provide feedback.</p>

                                        features by phases of app.&nbsp;</span></p>

                                        four user personas. The users personas helped me narrow down which features
