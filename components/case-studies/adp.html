                                        Several of the softwares that comprise the benefits systems have been obtained
                                        through acquisition and are, in some cases, complex, outdated and designed with
                                        little understanding of the end user. Our challenge is to work with the
                                        disparately developed systems—each possessing a distinct "look and feel"—to
                                        create a unified and cohesive experience for the user while identifying key
                                        pain points and streamlining their journey.

                                </h2>
                                <p class="col-md-8"><span> While the employee benefits projects share many
                                        similarities,
                                        each one requires a distinct solution that meets the unique needs of the users.
                                        However, in order to achieve these results, I follow the same deliberate
                                        process during each project: My first step is to meet with stakeholders to
                                        define the problem and ensure alignment in terms of our final objectives. From
                                        this, we are able to move forward into the discovery phase. During which, key
                                        issues/users are identified and we are able to begin to formulate solutions
                                        that address the client's particular pain points. As each client's challenge is
                                        different, I take the time to interview users to understand their individual
                                        needs as well as the business need. Once the solution is more clearly defined,
                                        I accompany the users through a testing process and receive their feedback.
                                        This can be an iterative process, however it ensures that the users needs are
                                        fully met and prevents the team from having to rebuild designs, optimizing
                                        project times. During the testing phase, I work collaboratively with
                                        development and POs to design and iterate based on feedback. This includes
                                        developing user flows and personas, brainstorming, sketching, prototyping,
                                        testing, designing and (re)iterating. This process allows me to uncover and
                                        address critical user pain points and improve their flow by creating careful
                                        and customized designs that result in user time savings, higher client
                                        retention, and friendlier products for the ADP to sell to their clients.
