                    within a small timeframe and not make major changes to the
                    design. I like a good challenge, as they say constraint can
                    bring creativity. I had to problem solve within the confines
                    of their requirements.</span

                      their users. As time was limited and I did not have access
                      to the users to do testing, I gathered as much information
                      as I could from the stakeholders. Users&nbsp;expressed
                      frustration with the page where they upload documents
                      (leases and tracks) and fill out forms based on the
                      documents.&nbsp;</span

                      differentiate the part of the page where people needed to
                      fill in information and upload documents and the part of
                      the page where information is displayed. I also placed
                      ‘call to action’ buttons in intuitive places within the
                      page and highlighted areas so the user would know what
                      information is mandatory. I used tabs in the forms area so
                      users could click between leases and tracks.</span
